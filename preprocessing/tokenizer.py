# 1. Remove special characters, numbers, puntctuations
# 2. Remove stop words
# 3.  Stemming:  Stemming is the process of reducing the words to their word stem or root form. The objective of stemming is to reduce related words to the same stem even if the stem is not a dictionary word.
# 4. Lemmatization: lemmatization reduces words to their base word, reducing the inflected words properly and ensuring that the root word belongs to the language.
# output: a dataframe with just the cleaned data
